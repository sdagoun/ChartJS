## Custom Widget for [Wakanda](http://wakanda.org)
The ChartJS widget allows you to create charts on wakanda 8 using datas stored in a dataClass

### Properties
This widget has the following properties:

* Type (enum) : You can choose which kind of charts you would like to design, whether the pie chart or the radar chart
* Datasource : To include the datasource where the datas are stored
* verticalLines : Only for the pie chart, you can choose to draw vertical lines
* horizentalLines: Only for the pie chart, you can choose to draw vertical lines
* track : Only for the pie chart, this allows you to visualize the value of a pie when the mouse hovers over it.

By default, the widget draws an example for both charts, so as you can see the effect you'll get once you update your dataClass.

The ChartJS was developped using the Flotr2 Javascript library.
